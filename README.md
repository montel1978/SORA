# SORA
TheHive, Cortex &amp; MISP
This is an update to my Cyber Security Lab Building Series, episodes 10 and 11, where I showed you how to deploy TheHive, Cortex and MISP using docker containers and how to integrate these services. 

You can checkout the below links for more info:

https://ls111.me/how-to-integrate-cortex-misp-with-thehive-in-your-soc/

Since I created this content, there have been some minor changes to the way these services are deployed, so this serves to bring everyone up to speed before we move on with the series.

I have included the updated docker-compose.yml which I encourage you try for yourself and as promised for those that watched to the end of the video, below is a link to the VirtualBox .ova file that you can import into your own VirtualBox environment.
